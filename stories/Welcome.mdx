# Welcome to Topaz for React Projects ;)

UI component library based on [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/). Topaz is a [MIT licensed](https://opensource.org/license/mit/) project that is developed and maintained by [Antônio Zanotti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoniozanotti/).

# Install Topaz React

Install tailwindcss [(instructions here)](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)

That's all! Topaz's components can be imported in your .tsx files.
```tsx

    return <TzButton label="Button" />
  }
}
```
# tailwindcss Preset Topaz React

You can **customize colours**, just update the tailwind.config.ts file.



### Design Point of View

The components was designed to work with these variants:

- **accent**: color for greatest emphasis.
- **primary** color for medium emphasis.
- **secondary**: color for lowest emphasis.
- **negative**: color for emphasizing actions that can be destructive.
- **black**: black on light theme, white on dark theme.
- **white**: white on light theme, black on dark theme.

### Customization Tips

If you want to change colors, I recommend:

- **accent**: use a vibrant colour.
- **primary**: use a darker colour than accent variant.
- **secondary**: use a lighter colour than accent variant.
- **negative**, "black", "white": I don't recommend change them.

## Dark and Light Theme

If you want to simulate how the component looks in dark theme, you can switch the theme in the toolbar. It uses [class strategy](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode) of [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/).

***The primary and secondary variations swap with each other. The black and white variations swap with each other.***

## Responsive

![shows the button for change size of the preview in the toobar!](/images/screen_size.png "Screen Size")
If you want to see how the component looks in different screen sizes, you can switch the screen size in the toolbar. Some components on screens larger than or equal to 1024px will be ~20% smaller than its mobile version.
